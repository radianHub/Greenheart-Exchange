This authorization is given to provide authority and power on the part of the aforementioned agents to give consent to any and all such diagnosis, treatment, or hospital care which the aforementioned medical professional, in the exercise of his/her best judgment, may deem advisable. I further agree to hold Greenheart Exchange, its staff, and representatives harmless for its actions relating to my treatment.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(b) I am responsible for paying any medical treatment administered that is not covered by insurance, even if the bill comes after I have returned home.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(c) I authorize Greenheart Exchange to provide my insurance and contact details with any medical provider from whom I received treatment if I fail to provide accurate or complete information myself.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(d) I authorize Greenheart Exchange to access my medical information if I am hospitalized for any reason.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(e) I have communicated with Greenheart Exchange about all my pre-existing medical conditions, and I have secured additional insurance that will cover any medical expenses incurred due to my pre-existing conditions.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(f) I will communicate information about any medical issues with Greenheart Exchange throughout the duration of my program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Money&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;(a) I will bring a minimum of USD$1,000 to support myself during the initial period of my program before I receive a paycheck and to pay for my return to my home country.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(b) I am responsible for any program-related fees charged by the U.S. Department of State, SEVIS, or Greenheart Exchange.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(c) I will reimburse all outstanding debts that I incur on the program, even if they are discovered after I return to my home country (e.g., security deposit, rent, medical bills, telephone charges).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(d) Certain tax deductions are required by U.S. and state laws. I understand that the net amount of pay that I receive, after taxes, will be less than the gross amount that my employer agreed to pay.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
